/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for VoltaView Auth.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and associated ESP32 data. Only the authenticated user can read and write their own profile data. ESP32 Data can only be written by the esp32.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/esp32_data/{esp32DataId}: Stores ESP32 sensor data, accessible only by the esp32.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users cannot list all user profiles.
 * - ESP32 data is private to each user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'userId' is present in both the /users/{userId} path and as a field within the /users/{userId}/esp32_data/{esp32DataId} documents, enabling direct authorization checks without additional reads.
