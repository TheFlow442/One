/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for VoltaView Auth.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only
 * access their own data, and no data is publicly accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where {userId} is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/esp32_data/{esp32DataId}: Stores ESP32 data for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.
 * - Users can only read and write ESP32 data associated with their user ID.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for privacy and security reasons.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for rapid schema iteration.
 *   Only authorization-critical fields are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is included in both the `/users/{userId}` path and as a field within
 * the `/users/{userId}/esp32_data/{esp32DataId}` documents. This redundancy
 * allows for efficient and secure rules without additional `get()` calls.
